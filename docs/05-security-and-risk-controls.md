# 05 — Security and Risk Controls

## Goal
Reduce attack surface and prevent cascading failures.

## Security Controls
- authentication and authorisation at the edge
- least-privilege secrets management
- input validation and output encoding
- rate limiting + anomaly detection

## Data Protection
- encryption in transit and at rest
- PII minimisation and retention rules
- audit logging for sensitive actions

## Risk Controls
- circuit breakers for external dependencies
- safe defaults and feature flags
- disaster recovery assumptions documented

## Outcome
A blueprint with explicit security posture and operational guardrails.
