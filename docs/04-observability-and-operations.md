## Goal
Operate the system with clear signals and fast diagnosis.

## Observability
- structured logs (JSON)
- metrics (RED/USE)
- distributed traces with propagation

## SLOs and Alerts
- latency SLOs for critical endpoints
- error budget alerts
- queue depth and consumer lag alerts
- saturation alerts (CPU, memory, DB)

## Operational Playbooks
- deploy and rollback strategy
- incident response checklist
- capacity planning cadence

## Outcome
Production-grade operational readiness from day one.
